This repository shows the enhanced Text Steganography technique for hiding text Messages using; Conditional Logic Algorithm![image](https://github.com/Diana11-Michelle/Cipher_Vault_1/assets/42889294/585b8739-e71d-409a-bfee-1fcb87fc450a)
This tool receives input on the "hide" navigation drawer and conceals the secret message using randomized paragraph generated at the backend.There after, it saves a file as a .txt file.
In the "Extract" navigation drawer, the tool gives an option for a user to select the .txt file withe secret message and then when the user chooses the file, the reverse algorithm is run and the secret message is got.
There will be HMAC used during concealing of the message that will prompt users to enter it while extracting it.
In adddition, a hash function will be embedded at the footer of the .txt file so that it adds to the security and exchange of the  file.
